{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Format and Update All DAX Measures in Semantic Model\n","\n","This script connects to a Microsoft Fabric semantic model, iterates through all tables and their DAX measures, formats each measureâ€™s DAX expression using the online service [daxformatter.com](https://www.daxformatter.com), and updates the model with the formatted expressions. It includes error checking to skip measures that fail to format, ensuring only valid and improved DAX is written back to the model. This helps maintain clean, readable, and consistent DAX code across your semantic datasets.\n"],"metadata":{"nteract":{"transient":{"deleting":false}},"microsoft":{"language":"python","language_group":"synapse_pyspark"}},"id":"e1f5967e-25ed-4391-b89b-2655f6376d32"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Installing semantic link labs"],"metadata":{"nteract":{"transient":{"deleting":false}},"microsoft":{"language":"python","language_group":"synapse_pyspark"}},"id":"0c529e64-6357-40aa-ab84-8dae04ae6747"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%pip install semantic-link-labs"],"outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"metadata":{"microsoft":{"language":"python","language_group":"synapse_pyspark"},"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true}},"id":"f137a429-efb3-4408-8bd9-085f31104e07"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Importing Modules"],"metadata":{"nteract":{"transient":{"deleting":false}},"microsoft":{"language":"python","language_group":"synapse_pyspark"}},"id":"f4ef7d1b-09ae-45be-8c3e-45d451193f5e"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import requests\n","from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n","from sempy_labs.tom import connect_semantic_model"],"outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"metadata":{"microsoft":{"language":"python","language_group":"synapse_pyspark"}},"id":"e4eec4e4-751d-4261-98de-16f181da2ae5"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Defining a Method in Python"],"metadata":{"nteract":{"transient":{"deleting":false}},"microsoft":{"language":"python","language_group":"synapse_pyspark"}},"id":"f7cceeff-6458-4406-b69c-659e6a90de22"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def format_and_update_all_measures(\n","    workspace: str,\n","    dataset: str,\n","    region: str = 'US',\n","    line: str = 'short'\n",") -> None:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Connects to a Microsoft Fabric semantic model and updates all DAX measures\n","    with formatted DAX expressions retrieved from daxformatter.com.
